## purpose
* The purpose of this workshop is to give you an idea about how to code a personal home page.Also, it aims to provide you digital identity. if you are applying for a new job or starting a project, most people will search for your name online. So, having the control over what information you would like to share is such a powerful thing in these days. therefore, we are here to create our first personal homepage. 

## flow
* First of all, I want you to download the file named instruction-for-workshop.docx under this address https://github.com/SemihOzden/eestec_event
* Then, we want you to follow the steps one by one from this file.  If you have any questions, we will be there to help you during the workshop. Please don't hesitate to ask us anything. 
* Everyone should develop their own page so it would be better if you work individually. You can ask help or get hint from your friends!
* At 17:00, we want you to present your personal homepage in the class. Each presentation should take 2-3 minutes.
* Have fun and start coding!
